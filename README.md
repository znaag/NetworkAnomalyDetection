- Multiple clustering approaches (K-means, DBSCAN)
- Anomaly detection using various methods:
  - Isolation Forest
  - Autoencoder
  - Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
  - One-Class SVM
  - LSTM Autoencoder
- Time series analysis and forecasting using ARIMA
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)
- Synthetic data generation using GANs
- Comprehensive visualization of results

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-analysis.git
cd network-traffic-analysis
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your network traffic data in CSV format with the following columns:
   - timestamp
   - throughput
   - latency
   - packet_loss
   - congestion
   - Other relevant network metrics

2. Update the data loading section with your dataset paths:

network_data = pd.read_csv('your_network_dataset.csv')
network_data_labeled = pd.read_csv('your_labeled_dataset.csv')
```

3. Run the analysis:
```python
python network_analysis.py
```
